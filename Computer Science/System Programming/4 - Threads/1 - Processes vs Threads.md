A thread is short for "thread-of-execution", representing the sequence of instructions given to and executed by the CPU. It's given a stack to remember where to return to in function calls and to have a place to store the values of automatic variables and parameters. It's similar to a process except there's no copying, which means threads can share the same address space, variables, heap, and everything else besides the stack. The system call to create one is `clone`, but we will be using the POSIX library `pthread` instead. Threads are more lightweight than processes and are therefore preferred for concurrency.

We typically create separate processes when we need more security and less sharing between them, when running another program using `exec`, when each process operates on something in the system and we don't want to worry about race conditions, or when the amount of communication is minimal enough that simple IPC suffices.

On the other hand, threads are better when we want to leverage our multi-core systems for a single task, the overhead of processes is too large, better communication between processes is required, or when we want all the threads to be part of the same process.
