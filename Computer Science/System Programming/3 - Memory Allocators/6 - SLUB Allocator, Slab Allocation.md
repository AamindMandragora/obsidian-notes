If we were creating an allocator for the kernel, we need a low memory footprint and the actual allocations to be as contiguous and cache-friendly as possible. For every system call, the kernel's pages need to get loaded into memory. Of course, this allocator needs to be really fast. The SLUB allocator `kmalloc` is a segregated list allocator with minimal splitting and coalescing, instead focusing on having more realistic allocation sizes and a low overall memory footprint. This allocator will conform to page sizes, which are in spans of 4Kib or 4096 bytes. It keeps pre-initialized objects in memory pools (slabs) for instant reuse, which have three states depending on how full they are.
