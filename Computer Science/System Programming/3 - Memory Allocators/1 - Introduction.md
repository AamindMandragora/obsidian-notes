Allocating and deallocating heap memory, an expandable and contractable contiguous series of addresses at the system level, is one of the most common operations in any program. In POSIX, the movable edge where the data segment ends (and the ) is called the system break, which we can edit using `sbrk`. However, that function is usually abstracted away by a memory allocation system that keeps track of which memory is allocated and freed.
