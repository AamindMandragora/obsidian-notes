The kernel keeps track of the file descriptors and what they point to (which can be more than files). They can be reused between processes, but are unique within one. They also may have a notion of position, known as seekable streams. Programs can read files on disk completely because the OS keeps track of the position in the file, an attribute belonging to the process as well. Other file descriptors point to other pieces of information, like network sockets, that are unseekable streams.
