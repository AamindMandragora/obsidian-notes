A process is an instance of a computer program that may or may not be running, Each program is allocated a single process at the beginning, but can make more. Programs consist of: a binary format detailing which parts are executable, which are constants, which are library includes, etc.; a set of machine instructions; a Program Counter; constants; and libraries to link and where to fill in their addresses.

Processes are powerful but isolated, as normally, no process can communicate with another process, which is useful when working in a system where different processes have different permissions. There's no way to unintentionally change another process's state, but there are other intentional ways.
