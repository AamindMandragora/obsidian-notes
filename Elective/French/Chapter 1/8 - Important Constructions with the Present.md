Many verbs can be directly followed by the infinitive. For example, the immediate future can be expressed through conjugating "aller" and appending the infinitive, and the recent past can be expressed by replacing "aller with "venir de". For actions that someone is in the middle of, conjugate "être", add "en train de", then add the infinitive. For impersonal expressions (using "il" or "ce" as the object), use the present tense for the primary verb (often "être", "avoir", "faire", etc.) and add the infinitive.
