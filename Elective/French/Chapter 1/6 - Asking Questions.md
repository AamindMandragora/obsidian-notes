In French, you can ask a question in several ways. One way is to change the intonation so your tone rises at the end, or suffix the sentence with "non" (no) or "n'est-ce pas" (isn't it) (most common while spoken). Other ways are to put "est-ce que" (is it that) at the start of the second (used most often with the subject "je"). The final way is to reverse the pronoun and the verb, unless when the question word is "qui" as that is often also the subject. This technique is especially common with "pourquoi" and "comment". When the subject is a noun, place it before the verb and repeat the pronoun.
