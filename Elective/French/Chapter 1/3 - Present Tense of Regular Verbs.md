The French present tense can be interpreted as a progressive action (currently doing), habitual action (often does), or a response to a doubt (they do). The proper terms are the simple present, present progressive, and present emphatic.

We conjugate French verbs to the present tense depending on the subject of the verb. In French, the possible subjects are "je", "tu", "il / elle / ons", "nous", "vous", "ils / elles" (corresponding to I, you, they, we, you all, they all).

**Example**: For the verb **parl**_er_, the bolded part "parl" is the stem (_le radical_) and stays the same when conjugating, while the italicized part "er" is the ending and determines the conjugation pattern. Together, they make up the infinitive form of the verb.

There are three main verb endings: "-er", "-ir", and "-re".
To conjugate "-er" verbs, take their stems and append the endings "-e", "-es", "-e", "-ons", "-ez", "-ent".
