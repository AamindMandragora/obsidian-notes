To indicate actions that will be done in the future, we can use the simple future tense. The endings are "-ai", "-as", "-a", "-ons", "-ez", "-ont". For regular "-er" and "-ir" verbs, use the infinitive as the stem, and for regular "-re" verbs, the stem is the infinitive minus the final "-e". For "-er" verbs with spelling changes in the present (that aren't an accent switch or to preserve a soft consonant sound), the simple future stem will use those spelling changes as well.

We can use the simple future as a more formal alternative to the immediate future, in sentences with "quand / lorsque" (when) or "dès que" (as soon as) if the connected action is in the future, or in "si" clauses when the if is followed by a verb in the present tense.

Some irregular verbs have irregular future stems as well, but the endings are the same no matter what.
