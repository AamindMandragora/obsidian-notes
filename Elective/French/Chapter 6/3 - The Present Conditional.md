To refer to possible events, polite requests, or in "si" clauses where the condition is in the imperfect, we can use the conditional (often translated to would in English).

To form it, use the same stem as the simple future and the same endings as the imperfect ("-ais", "-ais", "-ait", "-ions", "-iez", "-aient"). Verbs that are irregular in the simple future use the same irregular stems in the conditional.

For "quand" clauses, use either only the present tense or the simple future.

For "si" clauses, if the condition is a reality, conjugate it in the present tense and use either the present or simple future to conjugate the result. If the condition is a possibility, conjugate it in the imperfect and the result in the conditional. If the condition was never fulfilled, use the past perfect and put the result in the composite conditional (conjugate the corresponding auxiliary verb in the conditional and add the primary verb's past participle).
