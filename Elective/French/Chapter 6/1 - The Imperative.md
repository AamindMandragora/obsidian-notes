When giving a command, order, or suggestion to someone(s) else, we can use the imperative tense. It is very direct as a command, so use it with "please" ("s'il te / vous plait") or use the conditional instead.

The three forms of the imperative are "tu" (order to someone you can be informal with), "vous" (order to someone you can't be informal with or multiple people), or "nous" (suggestion or order that includes oneself as well).

To convert the present tense to the imperative, drop the subject in the "nous" and "vous" cases. For "tu", also drop the "-s" only for verbs ending in "-er", "-frir", and "-vrir".

There are only four verbs with irregular imperative forms (although "vouloir" is only used to mean "please" in formal situations).

| French  | English | Tu      | Vous      | Nous     |
| ------- | ------- | ------- | --------- | -------- |
| avoir   | to have | ai      | ayons     | ayez     |
| être    | to be   | sois    | soyons    | soyez    |
| savoir  | to know | sache   | sachons   | sachez   |
| vouloir | to want | veuille | veuillons | veuillez |

In negative commands, place the "ne... pas" around the verb (and the pronoun for pronominal verbs).

For the imperative tense of pronominal verbs, the pronoun comes after the verb in the affirmative and directly before in the negative. For the object "te", replace it with "toi" in the affirmative only.

Object pronouns follow the verb in the affirmative imperative and come before it in the negative imperative, but still follow the same relative ordering.
