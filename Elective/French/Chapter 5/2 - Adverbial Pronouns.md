In French, the adverbial pronouns "y" and "en" replace nouns that are the object of a preposition ("y" is used for "à", and "en" is used for "de"). "Y" can replace place names to mean "there" or replace a thing or idea to mean "(about) it / them". "En" can replace "de + place" to mean "from there", "partitive + thing" to mean "it", "indefinite article + thing / person" to mean "of them", "quantity + thing / person" to mean "of it / them" (quantity must be repeated), "verb object / de + thing" to mean "it / one of / of them / some". There's no agreement with "en" in the composite past, and "y" always precedes it. The order of object pronouns is

1. me / te / se / nous / vous
2. le / la / les
3. lui / leur
4. y
5. en
