In French, to talk about indivisible nouns or uncountable amounts, we use the preposition "de" attached to the definite article to create "du / de la / de l'". This is in contrast with indefinite articles, which are used with countable quantities. In negative sentences, every partitive article changes to "de". With expressions of quantity, use "de" with no article regardless of gender or number.
