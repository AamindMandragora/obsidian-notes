Certain pronouns in French replace nouns or situations (usually translated to "this" or "that" in English) and don't make agreements with gender or number. For the verb "être", we precede it with the indefinite demonstrative pronoun "ce". For other verbs, the pronoun is "cela" (or "ça" in spoken French). We also use "cela" when there's an object pronoun before "être". In spoken French, "ceci" and "cela" are pronouns meaning "this" and "that".
