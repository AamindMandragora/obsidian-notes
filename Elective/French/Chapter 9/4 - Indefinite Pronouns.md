| certain.e.s     | certain ones         |

Indefinite pronouns can function as subjects, objects, or objects of prepositions. When using a pronoun that expresses quantity as an object, "en" must be used. When expressing "someone / something" and their negations plus an adjective, it must be "de + adjective" in the masculine form.
