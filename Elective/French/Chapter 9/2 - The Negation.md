To negate the meaning of an affirmative sentence, wrap "ne... pas" around the conjugated verb. We can place other forms of negation or restriction by changing the "pas" to something else.

| French       | English                 |
| ------------ | ----------------------- |
| jamais       | never / not ever        |
| pas encore   | not yet                 |
| rien         | nothing / not anything  |
| personne     | no one / nobody         |
| plus         | no longer / not anymore |
| pas du tout  | not at all              |
| toujours pas | still not               |
| guère        | hardly / barely         |
| que          | nothing but / only      |

For restrictions like "ne... que", instead of wrapping it around the verb, enclose what is actually being restricted (could be after the object). The negation will at least wrap around the (first or only) conjugated verb being negated. If the verb being negated is in the infinitive, the two parts of the negation stay together and come directly before the verb.

"Personne" and "rien" are negative pronouns and can function as the subject or direct object of a sentence, or the object of a preposition, and are placed after the verb or preposition they're associated with. They can also be used at the beginning of the sentence as subject pronouns, followed by "ne".

Negations can be combined to express more complicated ideas. "Rien", "personne", and "jamais" may be used in one-word answers.
