In French, to describe states of being or ongoing / habitual past actions, we can use the imperfect. To form it, take the verb's present tense conjugation for "nous", drop the "-ons" and add the endings "-ais", "-ais", "-ait", "-ions", "-iez", "-aient". The only exception is etre, which uses the stem "-ét".

Verbs that change their stems to maintain a soft "g" or "c" sound in the present tense also do so for imperfect endings that begin with "a".

To negate the imperfect, simply place "ne... pas" around the verb.

We use the imperfect to describe on-going actions in the past with unclear endings (typically interrupted with past composite), to describe habits or repeated events in the past, or to describe states of being.
