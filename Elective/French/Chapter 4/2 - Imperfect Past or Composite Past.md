When talking about the past, both the composite and imperfect tenses will inevitably be used, and it's hard to know which one to use at any given moment. Composite often answers "What happened?" while imperfect usually answers "What was going on?"

For habits and repeated actions, use the imperfect, but for a change in said habits, use composite. Imperfect will also be used to describe the general state of objects, while composite is for actions limited in time. Descriptive actions will be in imperfect, while actions that advance the story are in composite.
