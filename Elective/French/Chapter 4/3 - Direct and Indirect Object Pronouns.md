A direct object is a noun following the verb that answers the question "what?" or "whom?" and their pronouns agree in number and gender with them.

| French  | English        |
| ------- | -------------- |
| me      | me             |
| te      | you            |
| le / la | him / her / it |
| nous    | we / us        |
| vous    | you (all)      |
| les     | them           |

"Le / L'" can also replace adjectives or verbs.

Direct object pronouns precede the verb they're an object of (including the auxiliary in tenses like the composite past), and are included inside negations. If their verb is in the infinitive, they always come directly before it. In the affirmative imperative, the object pronoun succeeds the verb and is hyphenated (also, "me / te" becomes "moi / toi").

Past participles agree in gender and number with a preceding direct object (add an "e" if it's feminine and add an "s" if it's plural).

Indirect objects are nouns which indirectly (separated by a preposition) receive the action of a verb. In French, they are always preceded by the preposition "à" and can be replaced by indirect object pronouns.

| French | English      |
| ------ | ------------ |
| me     | to me        |
| te     | to you       |
| lui    | to him / her |
| nous   | to us        |
| vous   | to you (all) |
| leur   | to them      |

Indirect object pronouns are placed just like direct object pronouns. If there's a direct and indirect object pronoun for the same verb, the direct object pronoun will usually be placed closer to the verb, except for the third person singular and plural ("lui" and "leur").
