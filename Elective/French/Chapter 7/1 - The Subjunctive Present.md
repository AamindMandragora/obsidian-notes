The four moods in French are indicative (statements), imperative (orders / suggestions), conditional (expressions of uncertain events), and the subjunctive (denoting the speaker's point of view).

The subjunctive endings are the same for all verbs (except avoir and être): "-e", "-es", "-e", "-ions", "-iez", "-ent". For most verbs, the subjunctive mood is formed by dropping the "-ent" from the present indicative third person plural conjugation of the verb and adding the corresponding ending. 

Many verbs that are irregular in the present indicative are regular in the subjunctive. For some verbs, the present indicative first person plural stem is used for "nous" and "vous" in the subjunctive (and some also have different regular stems).
