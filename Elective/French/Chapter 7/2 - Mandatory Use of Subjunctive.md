The subjunctive has to be used when there are two different subjects and the first subject is expressing doubt, opinion, will, or emotion, or if it contains one of the following conjunctions:

| French          | English       |
| --------------- | ------------- |
| a condition que | provided that |
| a moins que     | unless        |
| avant que       | before        |
| pour que        | so that       |
| sans que        | without       |

It is also always used with "bien que" (although) or "jusqu'à ce que" (until), regardless of the number of subjects.
