Regular adjectives become feminine by adding an "e" to the end if there wasn't one already. For irregular adjectives, there are several groups based on their endings.

| Masculine | Feminine |
| --------- | -------- |
| -el       | -elle    |
| -eil      | -eille   |
| -il       | -ille    |
| -on       | -onne    |
| -s        | -sse     |
| -en       | -enne    |
| -et-      | -ète     |
| -er       | -ère     |
| -eux      | -euse    |
| -eur      | -euse    |
| -teur     | -trice   |
| -f        | -ve      |
| -c        | -che     |
| -ou       | -olle    |

However, there are some exceptions that have two different masculine singular forms, and the feminine forms are based off the latter form.

| Masculine Singular | Masculine Plural | English   |
| ------------------ | ---------------- | --------- |
| beau / bel         | beaux            | beautiful |
| fou / fol          | fous             | crazy     |
| nouveau / nouvel   | nouveaux         | new       |
| vieux / vieil      | vieux            | old       |

Some adjectives are completely irregular.

| Masculine | Feminine | English  |
| --------- | -------- | -------- |
| doux      | douce    | gentle   |
| faux      | fausse   | false    |
| favori    | favorite | favorite |
| frais     | fraîche  | fresh    |
| gentil    | gentille | kind     |
| long      | longue   | long     |
| public    | publique | public   |

Some adjectives (and colors) don't change based on gender.

| French     | English   |
| ---------- | --------- |
| snob       | snob      |
| chic       | chic      |
| sympa      | nice      |
| cool       | cool      |
| bon marché | cheap     |
| kaki       | khaki     |
| marron     | brown     |
| noisette   | hazel     |
| orange     | orange    |
| turquoise  | turquoise |

Most adjectives are regular in the plural, which appends an "-s" to the end for the singular form of that gender. There are only two major exceptions: adjectives ending in "-s" or "-x" in the singular have identical masculine singular and plural forms, but the feminine plural form is regular, and adjectives ending in "-al" in masculine singular change to "-aux" in masculine plural.

Most adjectives appear after the noun, except for those relating to Beauty, Age, Numbers, Goodness, or Size.

| BANGS    | French             | English    |
| -------- | ------------------ | ---------- |
| Beauty   | beau / belle       | beautiful  |
|          | joli / jolie       | pretty     |
| Age      | jeune              | young      |
|          | vieux / vielle     | old        |
|          | nouveau / nouvelle | new        |
| Number   | autre              | other      |
|          | premier / première | first      |
|          | deuxième           | second     |
| Goodness | bon / bonne        | good       |
|          | mauvais / mauvaise | bad        |
| Size     | petit / petite     | little     |
|          | grand / grande     | tall / big |
|          | gros / grosse      | big / fat  |

Some adjectives can be placed before or after the nouns they describe, changing their meanings depending on their relative position. Adjectives before the noun tend to be subjective, while adjectives after the noun are more objective.

| French             | After            | Before           |
| ------------------ | ---------------- | ---------------- |
| ancien / ancienne  | very old         | former           |
| cher / chère       | expensive        | dear             |
| dernier / dernière | last preceding   | last time before |
| bon / bonne        | good             | charitable       |
| pauvre             | financially poor | unfortunate      |
| propre             | clean            | own              |
| seul / seule       | alone            | only             |
