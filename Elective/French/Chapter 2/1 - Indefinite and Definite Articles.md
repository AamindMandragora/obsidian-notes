French articles indicate the gender (masculine / feminine) and count (singular / plural) of nouns, and there's no pattern of any kind. For example, "the" can translate to "le", "la", "l'", or "les", depending on the noun. Those definite articles can be used for several purposes: specific nouns, nouns that have been mentioned previously, general concepts or truths, dates, days of the week, repeated moments, and body parts. We can also prepend those articles with "à" / "de" (to, at, in / from, of) to create "au, à la, aux" / "du, de la, des". Indefinite articles like "a / an" can translate to "un", "une", or "des". In the negative, they always become "de" (except after être). In French, articles are always necessary except for professions, religion, and nationality.

"Ce" in French can be translated to "this, that, these, those, he, she, they, it". However, its usage is situational. "C'est" and "ce sont" precede article-noun pairs and answers the questions "Qui est-ce que? / Qu'est-ce que c'est", while "Il est" and "Ils sont" precede adjectives, prepositional phrases, or nouns that don't require articles and usually describe previously discussed people or things.
