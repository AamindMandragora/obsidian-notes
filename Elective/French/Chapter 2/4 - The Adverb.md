Most adverbs are formed by taking an adjective and suffixing "-ment". If the masculine singular form of that adjective ends in a vowel, use that form, otherwise use the feminine singular form. If the masculine form ends in "-a/ent", replace it with "-a/emment". Two exceptions are "lent -> lentement (slowly)" and "gentil -> gentiment (nicely)". However, "bon" and "mauvais" become "bien" and "mal".

Adverbs modifying adjectives or adverbs are usually placed before them, while adverbs that modify verbs directly follow them (after any existing negations). Adverbs that comment on the entire sentence ("firstly", "generally", "fortunately", adverbs of time and place) are placed at the beginning or the end of the sentence. In passé composé, adverbs modifying verbs follow the English standard for relative placement, and are always placed after the negation.
