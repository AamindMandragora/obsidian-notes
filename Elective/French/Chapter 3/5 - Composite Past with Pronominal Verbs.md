All pronominal verbs use "être" as the auxiliary verb, placed between the reflexive object direct pronoun and the past participle of the pronominal verb. They only agree with a direct object preceding the verb. If the reflexive pronoun is indirect (verb associated with a preposition) or if the direct object comes after the verb, no agreements are made. For negations, the "ne... pas" wraps around the reflexive pronoun and the auxiliary verb.
