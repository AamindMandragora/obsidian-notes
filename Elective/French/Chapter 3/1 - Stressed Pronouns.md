In French, stressed pronouns are used as objects of prepositions and only for people.

| French | English |
| ------ | ------- |
| moi    | me      |
| toi    | you     |
| lui    | him     |
| elle   | her     |
| soi    | one     |
| nous   | we      |
| vous   | you     |
| eux    | them    |
| elles  | them    |

Common such prepositions include the following:

| French     | English         |
| ---------- | --------------- |
| de         | of / about      |
| avec       | with            |
| chez       | at the house of |
| derrière   | behind          |
| devant     | in front of     |
| à côté de  | beside          |
| à cause de | because of      |
| en face de | across from     |
| pour       | for             |

They can also be used as part of compound subjects ("he and I"), to emphasize a subject pronoun, after "ce + être", in sentences without verbs, prefixed to "même" to emphasize the object doing the action ("myself"), and after the comparative.
