The composite past is a French tense used to refer to past events with clear beginnings and ends, and is named as such because it is composed of two elements: the present tense of either "avoir" or "être", followed by a past participle.

For "-er" verbs, replace the ending with "é". For most "-ir" verbs, replace the ending with "i", although there are some irregular verbs.

| Verb     | Past Participle | English   |
| -------- | --------------- | --------- |
| courir   | couru           | to run    |
| couvrir  | couvert         | to cover  |
| mourir   | mort            | to die    |
| offrir   | offert          | to offer  |
| ouvrir   | ouvert          | to open   |
| souffrir | souffert        | to suffer |
| tenir    | tenu            | to hold   |
| venir    | venu            | to come   |

For most "-re" verbs, replace the ending with "u". However, for some of those verbs, the stem changes.

| Verb      | Past Participle | English         |
| --------- | --------------- | --------------- |
| boire     | bu              | to drink        |
| connaître | connu           | to know (nouns) |
| croire    | cru             | to believe      |
| lire      | lu              | to read         |
| paraître  | paru            | to seem         |
| plaire    | plu             | to please       |

Of course, there are irregular verbs, although patterns can be found within them as well.

| naître         | né              | to be born               |

Most verbs that end in "-oir" also replace that ending with "u", but a lot of those change their stems too.

| ---------- | --------------- | --------------- |
| apercevoir | aperçu          | to notice       |
| avoir      | eu              | to have         |

| pleuvoir   | plu             | to rain         |
| pouvoir    | pu              | to be able to   |
| recevoir   | reçu            | to recieve      |
| savoir     | su              | to know (facts) |

Most verbs use "avoir" as their auxiliary verb in the composite past, except for those related to movement, which use "être" and must agree with the noun's gender and number. A good mnemonic is "Dr and Mrs. P. Vandertramp":

We use the composite past for an action with a clear beginning and end, a series of past completed actions, a past action repeated a specific number of times, a change / interruption in state.

The composite past can be translated into the English simple past, present perfect, or the emphatic past depending on context. To negate it, wrap the auxiliary verb in "ne... pas".
