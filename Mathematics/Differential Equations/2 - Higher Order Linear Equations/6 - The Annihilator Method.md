To find the particular solution to the linear constant coefficient nonhomogeneous differential equation $\mathcal Ly=f(t)$, find a linear constant coefficient operator such that $\bar{\mathcal L}f=0$, then find a set of linearly independent solutions to the homogeneous problem $\bar{\mathcal L}\mathcal Ly=0$. The solution will be in the form of a linear combination of all solutions that aren't also solutions of the original associated homogeneous equation.
