For linear differential equations of the form $\mathcal Ly=f(t)$ for constant coefficient $\mathcal L$, if $f(t)$ can be written as a sum of polynomials, basic trigonometric functions, and exponentials in $t$, then we can use the method of undetermined coefficients to find the particular solution.

The method is as follows: make a guess for $y(t)$ in the same form as $f(t)$ with undetermined coefficients, substitute the guess into the differential equation, and solve for the coefficients.

If one or more of the terms of the guess is itself a solution to the associated homogeneous equation, multiply those terms by the smallest powers of $t$ that make them unique.
