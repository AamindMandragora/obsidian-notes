A more general method than the two above is variation of parameters, which solves any nonhomogeneous linear equation provided we can solve the homogeneous equation. If we have two linearly independent solutions $y_1(t), y_2(t)$ to the homogeneous problem, then we can try and find a particular solution by multiplying them by arbitrary functions $u_1(t), u_2(t)$. However, we only have one equation for the two unknowns, so we will force $u'_1(t)y_1(t)+u'_2(t)y_2(t)=0$. Substituting into the original equation gives us the two conditions $$\begin{align}u_1'(t)y_1(t)+u_2'(t)y_2(t)=0 \\ u_1'(t)y_1'(t)+u_2'(t)y_2'(t)=f(t)\end{align}$$and solving gives us $$\begin{align}u_1'(t)=-\frac{f(t)y_2(t)}{W(y_1,y_2)} \\ u_2'(t)=\frac{f(t)y_1(t)}{W(y_1,y_2)}\end{align}$$which can be integrated up and multiplied to find the particular solution. This method is generalizable to any order $n$ if we add more constraints like the first for every derivative of $u_1,u_2$ before the $n-1\text{st}$.
