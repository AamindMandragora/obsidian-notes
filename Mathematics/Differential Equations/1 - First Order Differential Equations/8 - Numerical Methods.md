# First Order (Euler) Method

Suppose that we are trying to solve the first order ODE $$y'=f(y,t), y(0)=y_0$$We can formally do this by integrating from $t=0$ to $t=\Delta t$ and applying the fundamental theorem of calculus to get $$y(\Delta t)-y(0)=\int_0^{\Delta t}f(y(t),t)dt$$This isn't super useful as we'd have to know $y(t)$ to find $y(t)$, but we can approximate $y(t)=y(0)$ for small $\Delta t$ to get $$y(\Delta t)\approx y(0)+f(y(0), 0)\Delta t$$We can keep going, using $y(\Delta t)$ to approximate $y(2\Delta t)$ and so on. This method is known as the first order **Euler scheme**. We can modify it slightly to create the equivalents of the midpoint and trapezoidal rule (called **Heun's method**). A more complicated rule is called the **fourth order Runge-Kutta method** ($RK_4$) and is the analog to Simpson's rule.
