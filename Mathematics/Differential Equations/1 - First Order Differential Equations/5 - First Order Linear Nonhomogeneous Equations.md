A first order linear nonhomogeneous initial value problem takes the form $$\frac{dy}{dt}+P(t)y=Q(t), y(t_0)=y_0$$and if $P, Q$ are continuous then $f(y,t)=-P(t)y+Q(t)$ and $\frac{\partial f}{\partial y}=-P(t)$ are also continuous and a unique solution is guaranteed by the Picard theorem. In fact, we can show that if $P, Q$ are continuous on some interval $(a,b)$ containing $t_0$ then the initial value problem has a unique solution on that interval.

Let's first consider the special case $Q(t)=0$ (linear homogeneous equation), in which case the equation is easily separable with solution $$y(t)=y_0e^{-\int P(t)dt}$$If we introduce a new variable $w(t)=y(t)e^{\int P(t)dt}$, then we can see $$\frac{dw}{dt}=\left(\frac{dy}{dt}+P(t)y\right)e^{\int P(t)dt}$$We can multiply the homogeneous differential equation by $e^{\int P(t)dt}$, then substitute the derivative of $w$ in to get $$\frac{dw}{dt}=Q(t)e^{\int P(t)dt}$$which is an exact derivative and can be integrated up. Using the definition of $w$, we can solve for $y$ and get $$y=e^{-\int P(t)dt}\int Q(t)e^{\int P(t)dt}+ce^{-\int P(t)dt}$$where the first term is called the **particular solution** and the second is the **homogeneous solution**. This way of finding a solution is called the **integrating factor** method. We first calculate the integrating factor $\mu(t)=e^{\int P(t)dt}$, multiply through, recognize the left side as an exact derivative and integrate up.
