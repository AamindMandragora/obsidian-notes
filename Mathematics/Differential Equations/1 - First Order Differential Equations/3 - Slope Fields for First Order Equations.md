**Slope fields** serve as a geometric interpretation for differential equations by plotting the value of the derivative $\frac{dy}{dt}=f(y,t)$ as a small line with slope equal to the derivative at each $(y, t)$ pair. Choosing an initial point and "following" the slope lines generates a solution curve for the differential equation, and analyzing the slope field can yield excellent insights for the behavior of solutions.

Often simply understanding the behavior of a differential equation despite not knowing the solution formula is enough, and there are a number of equations that can be analyzed in this way.

The **logistic model** is a common model for population growth, and the equation is $$\frac{dP}{dt}=k\left(1-\frac{P}{P_0}\right)P$$where $k$ is the growth rate and $P_0$ is the carrying capacity. For populations below $P_0$, the growth rate is positive, but above the carrying capacity the growth rate becomes negative as the population is too large to sustain. This model has also been applied to drilling oil, as the more oil is pumped out of the Earth, the harder it is to recover the remainder as there's only a finite amount. To estimate $P_0$, we can look at the graph of $\frac{dP}{dt}$, which clearly has a maximum when $P=\frac{P_0}{2}$, so we can simply multiply the corresponding $P$ by two to find $P_0$.
