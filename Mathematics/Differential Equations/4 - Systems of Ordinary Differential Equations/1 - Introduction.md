Systems of differential equations naturally arise, especially in the fields of physics and engineering. For example, in the absence of charges and currents Maxwell's equations for the electric and magnetic fields are given by $$\begin{aligned}\frac{\partial\mathbf B}{\partial t}=-\nabla\times\mathbf E \\ \mu_0\epsilon_0\frac{\partial\mathbf E}{\partial t}=\nabla\times\mathbf B\end{aligned}$$It's a system of six partial differential equations relating the first partial derivatives of the 3-vectors for the fields.

Another example from physics concerns the vibrations of a molecule, like carbon dioxide (a linear triatomic molecule). We can treat the bonds as linear springs with constant $k$, which leads to the following system of three second order differential equations: $$\begin{aligned}m_Ox_1''=-k(x_1-x_2) \\ m_Cx_2''=-k(x_2-x_1)-k(x_2-x_3) \\ m_Ox_3''=-k(x_3-x_2)\end{aligned}$$where $x_1, x_3$ are the positions of the two oxygen atoms and $x_2$ is the position of the carbon atom.

A set of models for the spread of a contagious disease are the SIR (susceptible, infected, recovered) models, one common set of them being $$\begin{aligned}S'=-\beta I S \\ I'=\beta IS-kI \\ R'=kI\end{aligned}$$where $\beta, k$ are constants representing the transmission and recovery rate for the disease.

In other situations it might help to write a higher order equation as a system of first order equations. For example, take $$y''+p(t)y'+q(t)y=f(t)$$Introducing the new variable $z(t)=y'(t)$ lets us write the following $$\begin{aligned}y'-z=0 \\ z'+p(t)z+q(t)y=f(t)\end{aligned}$$which can be vectorized into $\mathbf v'=\mathbf A(t)v+\mathbf g(t)$$for $$\mathbf v(t)=\begin{bmatrix}y(t) \\ z(t)\end{bmatrix}, \mathbf g(t)=\begin{bmatrix}0 \\ f(t)\end{bmatrix}, \mathbf A(t)=\begin{bmatrix}0 & 1 \\ -q(t) & -p(t)\end{bmatrix}$$This process is generalizable for any $n\text{th}$ order equation.
