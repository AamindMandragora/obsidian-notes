A homogeneous linear first order system takes the form $$\mathbf v'(t)=\mathbf A(t)\mathbf v$$Suppose that $\mathbf v_1(t), \mathbf v_2(t),\ldots, \mathbf v_n(t)$ are $n$ solutions to the above equation. The Wronskian $W(t)$ of these solutions is the determinant of the matrix with columns $\mathbf v_1(t), \mathbf v_2(t),\ldots, \mathbf v_n(t)$ (remember that $\mathbf v_k(t)$ is a vector and contains a solution for each equation in the system).

Define the **fundamental solution matrix** $\mathbf M(t)$ to be a matrix whose determinant is the Wronskian (and nonzero) and is constructed in the same way. Then, it must be invertible and, while there are many choices of a fundamental solution matrix, the most convenient one is where $\mathbf M(t_0)=\mathbf I$, given by $\mathbf M(t)\mathbf M^{-1}(t_0)$. The solution to the homogeneous system is given by $v(t)=\mathbf M(t)\mathbf M^{-1}(t_0)\mathbf v_0$.

Abel's theorem states that if we have $n$ solutions to the homogeneous linear system, then $W(t)$ satisfies $$W'(t)=\text{Tr}(\mathbf A(t))W(t)$$where $\text{Tr}$ denotes the trace of the matrix. When the system comes from a higher order linear equation of the form $$y^{(n)}+p_{n-1}(t)y^{(n-1)}+\cdots+p_1(t)y'+p_0(t)y=0$$the trace of the matrix $\mathbf A(t)$ equals $-p_{n-1}(t)$ and Abel's theorem implies that $W'=-p_{n-1}(t)W$. Just like Abel's theorem for higher order equations, we can draw the corollary that the Wronskian is either never zero or always zero in the solution interval.
