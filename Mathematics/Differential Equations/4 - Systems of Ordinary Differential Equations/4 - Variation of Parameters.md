For variation of parameters, the results for systems of first order equations look much simpler than those for higher order equations.

Consider the nonhomogeneous linear equation $$\frac{dv}{dt}=\mathbf A(t)\mathbf v+\mathbf g(t), \mathbf v(t_0)=\mathbf v_0$$Suppose that we find $n$ linearly independent solutions $\mathbf v_1(t), \mathbf v_2(t),\ldots, \mathbf v_n(t)$ to the corresponding homogeneous equation, then the general solution to the equation above is given by $$\mathbf v(t)=\mathbf M(t)\int_{t_0}^t\mathbf M^{-1}(s)\mathbf g(s)ds+\mathbf M(t)\mathbf M^{-1}(t_0)\mathbf v_0$$The proof of this is very similar to the integrating factor method for a first order scalar equation, defining a new variable $\mathbf w(t)$ that multiplies the fundamental solution matrix to get the general solution.
