Suppose we have a function $f(x)$ periodic with period $2L$, then it can be convenient to express said function in terms of sines and cosines.

The functions $1$, $\{\sin(\frac{n\pi x}{L})\}_{n=1}^{\infty}$, $\{\cos(\frac{n\pi x}{L})\}_{n=1}^{\infty}$ are orthogonal on the interval $(0, 2L)$ as the integral of the product of any two distinct functions from those above on the interval is zero. Therefore, the following identities are satisfied: $$\int_0^{2L}\cos\left(\frac{n\pi x}{L}\right)\cos\left(\frac{n\pi x}{L}\right)dx=L\delta_{n,m}$$$$\int_0^{2L}\sin\left(\frac{n\pi x}{L}\right)\sin\left(\frac{n\pi x}{L}\right)dx=L\delta_{n,m}$$$$\int_0^{2L}\sin\left(\frac{n\pi x}{L}\right)\cos\left(\frac{n\pi x}{L}\right)dx=0$$$$\int_0^{2L}1*\cos\left(\frac{n\pi x}{L}\right)dx=0$$$$\int_0^{2L}1*\sin\left(\frac{n\pi x}{L}\right)dx=0$$$$\int_0^{2L}1dx=2L$$Since these functions are orthogonal (not orthonormal), if we knew in advance that a given function $f(x)$ was expressible as a linear transformation of the above functions, we can easily find the coefficients by abusing the definition of linearly independent functions. Let $$f(x)=A_0+\sum_{n=1}^\infty A_n\cos\left(\frac{n\pi x}{L}\right)+\sum_{n=1}^\infty B_n\sin\left(\frac{n\pi x}{L}\right)$$Then the coefficients are given by $$\begin{align}A_0=\frac{1}{2L}\int_0^{2L}f(x)dx \\ A_n=\frac{1}{L}\int_0^{2L}f(x)\cos\left(\frac{n\pi x}{L}\right)dx \\ B_n=\frac{1}{L}\int_0^{2L}f(x)\sin\left(\frac{n\pi x}{L}\right)dx\end{align}$$The series equation for $f(x)$ is called a **Fourier series**, and all  $2L$-periodic $f(x)$ with continuous second derivatives can be represented as a Fourier series. If all points of discontinuity are jump discontinuities, then the Fourier series converges to the average of the negative and positive limits at those points.

The **square wave** $f(x)$ is defined to be $$f(x)=\begin{cases}1 &&x\in(0, \frac{1}{2}) \\ 0 && x\in (\frac{1}{2}, 1)\end{cases}$$and repeated periodically. We can easily compute the Fourier coefficients to be $$A_0=\frac{1}{2}, A_n=0, B_n=\frac{1-\cos(\pi n)}{\pi n}$$by evaluating the integrals.
