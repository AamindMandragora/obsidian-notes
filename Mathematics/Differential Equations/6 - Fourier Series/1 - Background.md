The **eigenvectors** of a matrix $\mathbf{A}$ are the nonzero vectors $v_i$ for which $\mathbf{A}v_i=\lambda_iv_i$. If $\mathbf{A}$ is an $n\times n$ real symmetric matrix, then there are $n$ linearly independent eigenvectors that form a basis for $\mathbb{R}^n$ and can be chosen to be orthonormal (magnitude one, perpendicular to every other vector in the basis). To represent a given vector in terms of an orthonormal basis, simply set the coefficients equal to that vector dotted with each vector in the basis.

Finally, if we suppose that the $n$ linearly independent eigenvectors are chosen to be orthonormal, let $\mathbf{U}$ be the matrix with $i^{\text{th}}$ column $v_i$, then the matrix $\Lambda$ defined by $$\Lambda=\mathbf{U}^T\mathbf{A}\mathbf{U}$$has the eigenvalues $\lambda_i$ along the diagonal and is zero everywhere else.
