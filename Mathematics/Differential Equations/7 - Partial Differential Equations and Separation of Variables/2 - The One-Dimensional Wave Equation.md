# Background

The wave equation is a PDE that governs wave propagation. In one spatial dimension it's given by $$\frac{\partial^2v}{\partial t^2}=c^2\frac{\partial^2v}{\partial x^2}$$where $v(x,t)$ represents the displacement of the string at location $x$ and time $t$. Since it's second order in time, we'll expect two initial conditions and two boundary conditions. For the initial conditions, the displacement and velocity of the string at time $t=0$ are usually given, and for the boundary conditions, we use Dirichlet, implying that the string is fixed at the ends. This leads to $$\begin{align}v_{tt}=c^2v_{xx} \\ v(0,t)=0 \\ v(L,t)=0 \\ v(x,0)=f(x) \\ v_t(x,0)=g(x)\end{align}$$We already know that the eigenvalues and functions of the Dirichlet eigenvalue problem are $\lambda_n=(\tfrac{n\pi}{L})^2$ and $u_n(x)=\sin(\tfrac{n\pi x}{L})$, so we'll look for solutions in the form $$v(x,t)=\sum_{n=1}^\infty\beta_n(t)\sin(\tfrac{n\pi x}{L})$$which we can substitute into the PDE, then notice that the functions of sine are linearly independent, so the coefficients satisfy the ODE $$\beta_n''=-\frac{n^2\pi^2c^2}{L^2}\beta_n$$and the solution is given by $$\beta_n(t)=B_n\cos(\tfrac{n\pi ct}{L})+C_n\sin(\tfrac{n\pi ct}{L})$$which we can plug into the expression for $v(x,t)$.
# Interpretation

While the solution to the heat equation is decaying exponential in time, the solution to the wave equation is sinusoidal, reflecting how heat problems decay to an equilibrium while waves support sustained oscillations.

Solutions to the wave equation are given by a superposition of terms of the form $\sin(\tfrac{n\pi x}{L})\cos(\tfrac{n\pi ct}{L})$, called **standing waves**. The wavenumber (spatial frequency) is $k=\frac{n}{2L}$ and the angular frequency (temporal frequency) is $\omega=\frac{nc}{2L}$.
# Solving for the Coefficients

The solution given two sections ago satisfies the wave equation with homogeneous Dirichlet boundary conditions. All that's left is to satisfy the two initial conditions. Substituting $t=0$ into the solution gives $$v(x,0)=\sum_{n=1}^\infty B_n\sin(\tfrac{n\pi x}{L})=f(x)$$which is a Fourier sine series problem, and we know from orthogonality that $$B_n=\frac{2}{L}\int_0^Lf(x)\sin(\tfrac{n\pi x}{L})dx$$Similarly, taking the partial derivative with respect to $t$ and evaluating at $t=0$ gives $$v_t(x,0)=\sum_{n=1}^\infty \frac{n\pi c}{L}C_n\sin(\tfrac{n\pi x}{L})=g(x)$$which is again a Fourier sine series problem which means we have $$C_n=\frac{2}{n\pi c}\int_0^Lg(x)\sin(\tfrac{n\pi x}{L})dx$$We can plug both sets of coefficients into the solution from two sections ago to get the final solution of the wave equation.
