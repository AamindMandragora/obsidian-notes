Unlike initial value problems which always have unique solutions given that they satisfy a lightweight hypothesis, boundary value problems may have any number of solutions.

For example, consider the two similar equations $$\begin{align}y''+\pi^2y=0,~~ y(0)=0,~~ y(1)=0 \\ y''+\pi^2y=\sin(\pi x),~~ y(0)=0,~~y(1)=0\end{align}$$The first equation has an easily solvable characteristic equation, and the corresponding solution is $$y(x)=A\cos(\pi x)+B\sin(\pi x)$$Imposing the two boundary conditions give two consistent linearly dependent equations, which means there are an infinite number of solutions.

After solving the second nonhomogeneous equation, we find the general solution is given by $$y(x)=A\cos(\pi x)+B\sin(\pi x)-\frac{x\cos(\pi x)}{2\pi}$$and when we try and solve the boundary value problem this time we get an inconsistent set of linear equations, meaning there is no solution.

A theorem determining the number of solutions of a second order linear two-point boundary value problem is as follows:

Consider the boundary value problem $$\begin{align}y''+p(x)y'+q(x)y=\mathbf{L}y=f(x) \\ \alpha_1y(a)+\alpha_2y'(a)=A \\ \beta_1y(b)+\beta_2y'(b)=B\end{align}$$where $p,q,f$ are continuous on $[a,b]$. The corresponding homogeneous equation is given by $$y''+p(x)y'+q(x)y=\mathbf{L}y=0$$Then the corresponding homogeneous equation has either a unique solution or an infinite number of solutions, and the original equation will have a unique solution if the homogeneous equation has a unique solution and either no solutions or an infinite number otherwise.

This theorem is reminiscent of the fact that a system of linear equations has a unique solution if and only if the only element in the matrix's nullspace is the zero vector. An equivalent condition is the matrix being **singular** (non-invertible), where the determinant is zero. In this case, we can analyze the matrix $$\mathbf{M}=\begin{pmatrix}\alpha_1y_1(a)+\alpha_2y_1'(a) & \alpha_1y_2(a)+\alpha_2y_2'(a) \\ \beta_1y_1(b)+\beta_2y_1'(b) & \beta_1y_2(b)+\beta_2y_2'(b)\end{pmatrix}$$
