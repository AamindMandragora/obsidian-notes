An **eigenvalue problem** is a boundary value problem involving determining values for an auxiliary parameter (eigenvalue) such that the problem has a non-trivial solution (eigenfunction). It takes the form: $$\begin{align}\mathbf{L}(\lambda)y=0 \\ \alpha_1y(a)+\alpha_2y'(a)=0 \\ \beta_1y(b)+\beta_2y'(b)=0\end{align}$$where $\mathbf{L}(\lambda)$ is a second order linear differential operator. This equation always has the trivial solution $y(x)=0$, and equations of this form always have either a unique solution or infinitely many. We must then find the values of $\lambda$ for which the boundary value problem has an infinite number of solutions.
