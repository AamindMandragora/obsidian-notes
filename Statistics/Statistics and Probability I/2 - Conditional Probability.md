A **conditional probability** is a probability given that some other event has occurred, and is equivalent to $$P(A\mid B)=\frac{P(A\cap B)}{P(B)}$$provided that $P(B)\neq 0$. In other words, the probability of the event $A$ occurring given the occurrence of $B$ is the probability of $A$ and $B$ happening divided by the probability of $B$ happening. If we visualize the events $A$ and $B$ as a Venn diagram, we'd be calculating the area of the intersection divided by the area of $B$ to get the ratio, or probability. The **multiplication rule** states that $$P(A\cap B)=P(A)P(B\mid A)=P(B)P(A\mid B)$$which we can rearrange to get $$P(B\mid A)=\frac{P(B)P(A\mid B)}{P(B)}$$
