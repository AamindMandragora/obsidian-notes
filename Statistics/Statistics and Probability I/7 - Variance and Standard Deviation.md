There are several different ways to characterize a random variable, but most of them reduce to its location (using the **mean** or **median**) or how spread out it is (**variance**). For a random variable $X$, we denote its variance as $Var[X]$, $\sigma^2$, or $\sigma_X^2$, which is defined as $$\sigma^2=E[(X-\mu)^2]=\sum_{x\in X}(x-\mu)^2f(x)$$where $\mu$ is the mean of the data, also equal to the expected value. Also, we can expand inside the expected value operator then use the properties of a linear operator to get: $$\begin{align}\sigma^2&=E[(X-\mu)^2]=E[X^2-2\mu X+\mu^2] \\ &= E(X^2)-2\mu E(X)+\mu^2 \\ &=E(X^2)-\mu^2 \\ &=E(X^2)-E(X)^2\end{align}$$where $X^2$ is a new random variable where every outcome equals the corresponding outcome in $X$ squared. Since expected value is a linear operator, $Var[aX+b]=a^2\cdot Var[x]$, and $SD[aX+b]=|a|\cdot SD(X)$, where $SD$ is the **standard deviation**, or the square root of the variance.
