Let $X$ be a discrete random variable with pmf $f(x)$, then the **expected value** of $X$ is denoted $E[X]$ and given by $$E[X]=\mu=\mu_X=\sum_{x\in S}x\cdot f(x)$$The expected value doesn't need to be an element of the sample space. We also denote the **mathematical expectation**, or the expected value, of a function $u(x)$ by $$E[u(X)]=\sum_{x\in S}u(x)f(x)$$The expected value operator $E$ is a linear operator.
